# MQDTCalculation

An multiple-channel quantum defect theory calculation for Feshbach resonance by using matlab

This is a program mainly for calculating Feshbach resonance of alkali atom's interaction. However, it also include the numerical optimization by using nelder-nord mead method, the dipole-dipole interaction caused by dipole-dipole interaction, and the secular perturbation for calculating the schordinger equation for 1/r^a form. The theoritical thinking and derivation is producted by genius Prof.Gao Bo, which creates the MQDT calculation. Also, the Great M. J. Cavagnero's secular pertubation help a lot.
Also, it incoude some little faculties likes zeeman effect ploting and so on.
